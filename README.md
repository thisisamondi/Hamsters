- HAMSTERWARS BACKEND -

This was a backend assignment I got from school.


* In the assignment we got pictures and objects containing fictional hamsters :D 
  We we're then assigned to create an API and import them to our database to access all of the hamsters in the final app.
  Also to create status codes to evaluate our app along the way and catch errors.  

* This is later on gonna result in an app called "hamsterwars" we're hamsters are gonna compete against each other. 

Tools used: 
- Node.js
- Express
- Firestore
- Insomnia
- Heroku
- Vs Code

* I also used Heroku to publish and operate the backend-app.
